* Autocomplete

I always liked flexible autocomplete where you can type a few letters, even skipping some letters, and it can find the file or word for you.

Your task is to write a function that determines if you can complete a sequence of characters to a given string.

Examples
#+begin_src clojure
(completes? "a" "autocomplete") ;=> true
(completes? "atc" "autocomplete") ;=> true
(completes? "hello" "hello") ;=> true
(completes? "ll" "hello") ;=> true
(completes? "llh" "hello") ;=> false
#+end_src

The rules. The function returns true if all of the following are true (otherwise false):

    - The first string contains only letters in the second string.
    - The first stringâ€™s letters are in the same order as in the second string.

Note that this means that you can match any number of letters between typed letters.
